            <h2>Rich Dad, Poor Dad</h2>
            <p>Robert Kiyosaki
Robert Kiyosaki (born April 8, 1947) is an American entrepreneur, investor, educator, and author best known for his personal finance classic Rich Dad Poor Dad. His unconventional views on wealth—emphasizing financial literacy, entrepreneurship, and leveraging assets—have made him one of the most influential figures in global financial education.

Key facts
Full name: Robert Toru Kiyosaki

Born: April 8, 1947, Hilo, Hawaii, U.S.

Spouse: Kim Kiyosaki (married 1986)

Known for: Rich Dad Poor Dad book series

Estimated net worth: ≈ $100 million (2023)

Residence: Phoenix, Arizona

Early life and education
Kiyosaki grew up in a Japanese American family in Hilo, Hawaii. His father, Ralph H. Kiyosaki, was a Ph.D. educator whose financial struggles inspired the “poor dad” figure in Robert’s writing. After graduating from the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy, he served as a Marine Corps helicopter pilot during the Vietnam War, earning an Air Medal before transitioning to business and sales work at Xerox 
.

Business career and Rich Dad philosophy
Kiyosaki launched several ventures, including Rippers, a company selling nylon wallets, before co-founding Cashflow Technologies Inc. in 1997 to publish and promote Rich Dad Poor Dad. The book contrasts two financial mindsets—working for money versus making money work for you—and has sold over 40 million copies in dozens of languages. His later works and the Rich Dad brand expanded into seminars, games like Cashflow, podcasts, and online courses 
.

Investment approach
Central to Kiyosaki’s teaching is distinguishing assets from liabilities. He advocates real-estate investment, business ownership, and using “other people’s money” (OPM) to build wealth—an idea he continues to promote on social media and in interviews 
. His portfolio includes real-estate holdings and interests in commodities such as gold and silver.

Influence and criticism
Kiyosaki’s influence stems from simplifying complex financial concepts for everyday readers. However, critics have questioned the accuracy of his anecdotes and the efficacy of his paid seminars, particularly following the 2012 bankruptcy of one of his companies, Rich Global LLC 
. Despite controversy, he remains a prominent advocate for financial education, urging individuals to pursue independence through informed investing and entrepreneurial thinking.</p>
